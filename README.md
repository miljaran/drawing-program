# drawing-program

This is a drawing program where the user can draw on canvas when the mouse is pressed down. The user is able to choose a color and a shape they want to draw. The available shapes are line, rectangle, circle and ellipse. In addition to drawing, the user can either undo the last changes or clear the entire painting. Itâ€™s also possible to save drawings into a file and load drawings from files.
